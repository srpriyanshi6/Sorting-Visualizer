# Sorting_Visualizer
Welcome to Sorting Visualizer! I built this application because I was fascinated by sorting algorithms, and I wanted to visualize them in action. I hope that you enjoy playing around with this visualization tool just as much as I enjoyed building it.

This is a web application showcasing the inner workings of sorting algorithms.

Implemented algorithms:
1) Bubble sort
2) Selection sort
3) Insertion sort
4) Merge sort
5) Quick sort
6) Heap sort


Features:
1) Colored representation of step being executed.
  1.1) Blue:default
  1.2) Yellow: Being compared
  1.3) Red: Identified as in incorrect position and to be moved
  1.4) Green: In correct position
2) 3 Controls for visualizations
  2.1) Speed of visualization (5 speed levels)
  2.2) Data size ()
  2.3) Generation of new data (Randomly generate new data).
4) Time and Space complexity of algorithm being visualized.
